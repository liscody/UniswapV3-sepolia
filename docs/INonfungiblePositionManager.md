## INonfungiblePositionManager

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address user) external returns (uint256)
```

### MintParams

```solidity
struct MintParams {
  address token0;
  address token1;
  uint24 fee;
  int24 tickLower;
  int24 tickUpper;
  uint256 amount0Desired;
  uint256 amount1Desired;
  uint256 amount0Min;
  uint256 amount1Min;
  address recipient;
  uint256 deadline;
}
```

### mint

```solidity
function mint(struct INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams params) external payable returns (uint256 tokenId, uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
```

Creates a new position wrapped in a NFT

_Call this when the pool does exist and is initialized. Note that if the pool is created but not initialized
a method does not exist, i.e. the pool is assumed to be initialized._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams | The params necessary to mint a position, encoded as `MintParams` in calldata |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| tokenId | uint256 | The ID of the token that represents the minted position |
| liquidity | uint128 | The amount of liquidity for this position |
| amount0 | uint256 | The amount of token0 |
| amount1 | uint256 | The amount of token1 |

### IncreaseLiquidityParams

```solidity
struct IncreaseLiquidityParams {
  uint256 tokenId;
  uint256 amount0Desired;
  uint256 amount1Desired;
  uint256 amount0Min;
  uint256 amount1Min;
  uint256 deadline;
}
```

### increaseLiquidity

```solidity
function increaseLiquidity(struct INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams params) external payable returns (uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
```

Increases the amount of liquidity in a position, with tokens paid by the `msg.sender`

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| params | struct INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams | tokenId The ID of the token for which liquidity is being increased, amount0Desired The desired amount of token0 to be spent, amount1Desired The desired amount of token1 to be spent, amount0Min The minimum amount of token0 to spend, which serves as a slippage check, amount1Min The minimum amount of token1 to spend, which serves as a slippage check, deadline The time by which the transaction must be included to effect the change |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| liquidity | uint128 | The new liquidity amount as a result of the increase |
| amount0 | uint256 | The amount of token0 to acheive resulting liquidity |
| amount1 | uint256 | The amount of token1 to acheive resulting liquidity |
